		<h3>Look Ahead!</h3>
        <p class="smallinfo">
            In June of 2024, I released "Look Ahead!" It is an EP based around the idea of an RPG following three kids 
            and their journey up a mountain. The art was done by my boyfie Drew, 
            and the full EP was made in about a month or so. It is video game inspired, specifically by Celeste, with 
            a mix of some chiptune songs and other styles.It is pretty short, but it's worth checking out!

            SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and many other platforms.)

        <p class="inforight">
            In November 2024, I released a second, shorter EP of five songs.
			A compilation of tracks I made after making Look Ahead. I wanted a smaller undertaking with a more concrete concept.
            It is about a lonely space bunny, hence the name. She is called Amie. She is alone, on a space station, 
            and she has been alone for a long time. You can listen to it below

				is the first game I ever made. It is a simple high score based game I made mostly in school.

				Something else I do a bunch every now and again is modding. I have released quite a few mods on gamebanana.
				Some fixing games, some dumb jokes and some quality of life changes. Most notable are my Bendy and The Ink Machine mods.
				Quality of Life (which is now outdated LOL) , is probably my best bendy mod I made, it is linked below.
				</p>
				<ul><a class="embed" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/471415"><img src="https://gamebanana.com/mods/embeddables/471415?type=large"/></a>
				</ul>
				<p>
				In 2023 I released a few mods that fixed several core issues with the games code
				My quality of life mod ended up becoming an update to the game with the help of one of the lead programmers.
				Which is like maybe the coolest bragging rights.
