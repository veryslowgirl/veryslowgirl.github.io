		<h3 class="infoleft">Look Ahead!</h3>
        <p class="smallinfo">
            In June of 2024, I released "Look Ahead!" It is an EP based around the idea of an RPG following three kids 
            and their journey up a mountain. The art was done by my friend (<a href="https://thesatiricalsatyr.carrd.co/" target=”_blank”>@portalpilled</a>), 
            and the full EP was made in about a month or so. It is video game inspired, specifically by Celeste, with 
            a mix of some chiptune songs and other styles.It is pretty short, but it's worth checking out! 
			(If you want, you can listen below, as well as on Spotify, 
            SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and many other platforms.)

        <p class="inforight">
            In November 2024, I released a second, shorter EP of five songs.
			A compilation of tracks I made after making Look Ahead. I wanted a smaller undertaking with a more concrete concept.
            It is about a lonely space bunny, hence the name. She is called Amie. She is alone, on a space station, 
            and she has been alone for a long time. You can listen to it below

        <p class="smallinfo">
            AMIE is a small EP I released in August 2025, it features 4 more traditional video game songs.
			AMIE is the same Lonely Space Bunny from before, these are tracks I made when trying to concept out
			the RPG itself. Whilst I still haven't made much for the RPG these songs  build the world an amount.
			Maybe eventually she will exist as more than a concept ;P

                    In 2023 I released a few mods for bendy and the ink machine that fixed several core issues with the game’s code.
					This included bugfixes, both simple and gamebreaking as well as quality of live improvements.
